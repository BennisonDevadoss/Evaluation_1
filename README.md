# Evaluation_1

1: Prime number: 

Algorithim: 
step 1: Start a program with function with argument. 
step 2: Inside the function first i check the number equal to one or two 
step 3: if the number is one or two, I print number is not a prime number. 
step 4: If the number is greater than two, I divide the number from number three to number -1
step 5: If the remainder will be zero, I print number is a prime number.otherwise I print the number is NOT prime. 

PSUDOCODE:

BEGIN
FUNCTION prime(number)
IF number ==== 1 || number === 2
PRINT number is not a prime
ENDIF
IF number> 2
SET i = 2
FOR i -> 2 to number
IF number MOD === 0
PRINT number is not a prime number
BREAK
ENDIF
IF i === number - 1
IF number MOD number -1 != 0
PRINT number is prime
BREAK
ENDFOR

2: Eqaual and Strict Eaual

Algorithim

step 1: first I declare a two const variabe
step 2: I define 2 in variable name a and i difine string 2 in variable name b. 
stpe 3: I check the two variable with equality operator
stpe 4: Check the two variable with strict equality operator.
