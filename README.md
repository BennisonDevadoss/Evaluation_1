# Evaluation_1

## 1: Prime number: 
```
Algorithim: 

step 1: Start a program with function with argument. 

step 2: Inside the function first i check the number equal to one or two

step 3: if the number is one or two, I print number is not a prime number. 

step 4: If the number is greater than two, I divide the number from number three to number -1

step 5: If the remainder will be zero, I print number is a prime number.otherwise I print the number is NOT prime. 
```

## PSUDOCODE: 
```
BEGIN
FUNCTION prime(number)
IF number ==== 1 || number === 2
PRINT number is not a prime
ENDIF
IF number> 2
SET i = 2
FOR i -> 2 to number
IF number MOD === 0
PRINT number is not a prime number
BREAK
ENDIF
IF i === number - 1
IF number MOD number -1 != 0
PRINT number is prime
BREAK
ENDFOR
```

2: Eqaual and Strict Eaual

Algorithim

step 1: first I declare a two const variabe
step 2: I define 2 in variable name a and i difine string 2 in variable name b. 
stpe 3: I check the two variable with equality operator
stpe 4: Check the two variable with strict equality operator. 


Psudocode

SET a  = 2
SET b  = "2"
a == b
PINT BOOLEAN
a === b
PRINT BOOLEAN


3: String Reverse

Algorithim: 

step 1: Firt I declare a string variable with string value and create a empty string variable. 
step 2: Find the variable length
step 3: And i save the index backward, from last index to first index to the empty variable. 

Psudocode: 

INIT string "bennison devadoss"
SET length = string.length
SET i = 0
WHILE i < length
reverse = reverse + string(length-i) -1
END WHILE
PRINT reverse. 

4: Word Reverse

Algorithim: 

step 1: Declare a string variable and enter some variable, declare some variables named diff reverse and count 
step 2: Calculate the strling length and store that length count in another variable name length. 
step 3: Calculate, how words are in string. 
step 4: First calculate the string's last words starting index. 
step 5: Store the last word to varaible named reverse.
step 6: Then find the next last word from string. 
step 7: And finally, store variable string's first word to variable name reverse. 


Psudocode: 

SET string = "hi hello how are you"
SET length = strng.lengh
INIT word = 0
FOR i -> 0 to length
IF stfing[i] + 1
   word = word +1
END IF
END FOR
SET diff = 0; 
SET = reverse = ""
SET = count = 0
FOR k = 1 -> word
 length = length -count
 i = count
 WHILE string[i - 1] != ""
   count = count + 1; 
   a-.
 END WHILE
 count = count + 1; 
 diff = length - count
 SET j = 0
 WHILE j < count
   reverse += string[diff - j]
   j+.
 END WHILE
END FOR
revere += reverse + " "
SET i = 0
WHILE string[i] != " "
  reverse += string[i]
  i+
END WHILE
PRINT reverse


5: Palindrome

Algorithim: 

step 1: Declare a string variable name with value racecar
step 2: declare a empty string variable 
step 3: find the string varaible length. 
step 4: And store the string of each index from last to first to the emptry variable.
step 5: Compare the variable string and reversed string
step 6: If both are same print the string is palindrome
step 7: or else the string is not a palindrome

Psudocode: 

SET string = "racecar"
SET reverse =""
SET length = string.length
FOR i = length -> 0
  revere += string[i -1]
END FOR
IF string == reverse
   PRINT string is a palindrome
ELSE 
   the string is not a palindrome
   
6: Array.forEach()  &  Array.map()

ALgorithim: 

Array.forEach

step 1: Declare a array variable with some string variable
step 2: Create a function, and that function takes three arguments. 
step 3: Initiailze the function to a variable. 
step 4: Finally, call the forEach method with call back function
step 5: Through the forEach method can be accessed array index, value, objects seperatly. 


Psudocode: 

SET names = ["Bennison", "Devadoss"]

SET fun = FUNCTION (para1 para2 para3)
     PRINT index
ENDFUNCTION fun


Array.map()

Algorithim

step 1: Declare a string array with some string values.
step 2: define a function and assign that function to a variable 
step 3: The function will convert the string to uppercase letter.
step 4: Call the array.map function with call back function. 
step 5: the changed array must be stored in aonther array.

Psudocode: 

SET fun = FUNCTION (para1)
       RETURN element.toUpperCase()
ENDFUNCTION
SET array = ["bennison", "devadoss"]
SET newArray = array.map(fun)
PRINT newArray

7: Random number

Algorithim: 

step 1: Declare a two integer with value one and five.
step 2: Create a function, and that function takes the two argument. 
step 3: Inside the function create a another variable called integer. 
step 4: Inside the function write a logic to generate a random number with the help of math.floor and math.random function. 
step 5: call the function and pass the two argument to that function. 

Psudocode: 

INIT integer
FUNCTION randomNumber(para1 para2)
        integer = Math.floor(Math.random() * (b - a) + 1))
        PRINT integer
ENDFUNCTION randomNumber
SET a = 5; 
SET b = 1; 
randamNumber(arg1, arg2)

8: Array Duplicate

Algorithim: 

step 1:
