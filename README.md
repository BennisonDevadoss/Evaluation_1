# Evaluation_1

## 1: Prime number: 
```
Algorithim: 

step 1: Start a program with function with argument. 

step 2: Inside the function first i check the number equal to one or two

step 3: if the number is one or two, I print number is not a prime number. 

step 4: If the number is greater than two, I divide the number from number three to number -1

step 5: If the remainder will be zero, I print number is a prime number.otherwise I print the number is NOT prime. 
```

## PSUDOCODE: 
```
BEGIN
FUNCTION prime(number)
IF number ==== 1 || number === 2
PRINT number is not a prime
ENDIF
IF number> 2
SET i = 2
FOR i -> 2 to number
IF number MOD === 0
PRINT number is not a prime number
BREAK
ENDIF
IF i === number - 1
IF number MOD number -1 != 0
PRINT number is prime
BREAK
ENDFOR
```

2: Eqaual and Strict Eaual

Algorithim

step 1: first I declare a two const variabe
step 2: I define 2 in variable name a and i difine string 2 in variable name b. 
stpe 3: I check the two variable with equality operator
stpe 4: Check the two variable with strict equality operator. 


Psudocode

SET a  = 2
SET b  = "2"
a == b
PINT BOOLEAN
a === b
PRINT BOOLEAN


3: String Reverse

Algorithim: 

step 1: Firt I declare a string variable with string value and create a empty string variable. 
step 2: Find the variable length
step 3: And i save the index backward, from last index to first index to the empty variable. 

Psudocode: 

INIT string "bennison devadoss"
SET length = string.length
SET i = 0
WHILE i < length
reverse = reverse + string(length-i) -1
END WHILE
PRINT reverse. 

4: Word Reverse

Algorithim: 

step 1: Declare a string variable and enter some variable, declare some variables named diff reverse and count 
step 2: Calculate the strling length and store that length count in another variable name length. 
step 3: Calculate, how words are in string. 
step 4: First calculate the string's last words starting index. 
step 5: Store the last word to varaible named reverse.
step 6: Then find the next last word from string. 
step 7: And finally, store variable string's first word to variable name reverse. 


Psudocode: 

SET string = "hi hello how are you"
SET length = strng.lengh
INIT word
